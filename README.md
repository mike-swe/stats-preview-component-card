## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
I really enjoyed this project cause it taught me the importance of planning before coding, which i didn't do & ended up running into some trouble along the way and taking too long to complete but hey i did anyway.

### Useful resources

- [JavaScript Hero](https://www.jshero.net/en/home.html) - I know this wasn't a JS project but i really would love to share this free resource with you, if you still going round in circles trying to figure out where & how to get started with javascript then this is for you. The app is so easy to navigate and also they give you some bite size examples on how to solve every challenge presented to you, i always refer to this whenever i encouter any problems with my JS projects.
